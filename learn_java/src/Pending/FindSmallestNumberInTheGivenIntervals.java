 * Find the ith smallest number in these intervals.

for eg:- 
Suppose we have intervals like 5-10, 8-12. 
Then total numbers in these two intervals would be: {5,6,7,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,12} 
So, 1st smallest number: 5 
4th smallest number: 8 
5th smallest number: 8 (here is the 
change since now we have duplicate elements also) and so on.
