You need to write this program again, without using any library methods. Take the following inputs from user and print the following output. 

1   1 
1   11 
0   011 
1   0111 
0   00111 
0   000111 
0   0000111 

i.e if user types 1 then 1 will be at printed right shift, and 0 will be printed left shift. 
Note: There is no definite count of number of Inputs user wants to give, or sequence of inputs user wants to give. User can give any number of inputs, 
and it should display the result as above.
